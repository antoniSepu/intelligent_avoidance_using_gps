# ROS package: intelligent_avoidance_using_gps

This package is part of my final degree project.

It has been tested in an AION Robotics R1 with an Astra camera in ROS melodic and Ubuntu 18.04LTS.

The lauch files require:

https://github.com/ros-perception/depthimage_to_laserscan

https://github.com/orbbec/ros_astra_camera

https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation

https://github.com/cra-ros-pkg/robot_localization

I have also made use of https://github.com/sonyccd/roboclaw_ros

But I have made slight modifications to match with my odometry model. They are in the change required directory.
